Linemen include the Center, Left Guard and Right Guard. Some more specialized linemen include running backs, who are positioned on the far ends of the line on both sides. Running backs can be given the ball by a hand-off or a pass from the Quarterback, and can then run down the field in an attempt to gain yardage or score by running into the other team's end zone.\n",
